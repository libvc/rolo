* bootstrap: Renamed file from bootstrap.sh.

* configure.ac: First attempt at an autoconf input file.  Added
lots of stuff to make the compile run smoother.

* Makefile.am: Added doc directory to the make.  Decided to remove
the doc file because man is not ready for dist yet.  Forced some
other stuff to be included in a dist.

* Makefile.am: First attempt at an automake input file.
