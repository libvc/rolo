RELEASE NOTES FOR ROLO

release 001 (2003-02-22)

this is the first release of the rolo package.  it has been developed
and tested on FreeBSD 4.7.  keep in mind that you will need a file
in your %{HOME}/.rolo/ directory titled contacts.vcf and in the
same format as the data.vcf file format (which is in vCard 3.0
format).  this release only has capabilities to read from the file
and display the entries to screen.
