Rolo 011 (2003-05-20)

* Searching is now fixed and the results are appearing properly on
the screen.  Searches are now performed case-insensitive.

* Added ability to search forwards or backwards for the next match.

* There is now a dependency on libvc if you want to perform your
own build of rolo.  You can download libvc from the rolo web site
(see the README file for the web address).

* The mutt_vc_query utility is no longer distributed with rolo.  It
is now a separate package.  You can download mutt_vc_query from the
rolo web site (see the README file for the web address).

Rolo 010 (2003-05-04)

* Added a new utility for mutt's `query_command' called `mutt_vc_query'.
This utility will allow a mutt user to query the email addresses
in `contacts.vcf' with the `Q' command in mutt.  See the README
file for how to implement.

Rolo 009 (2003-04-26)

* Preferred telephone number and email addresses are now displayed
in the index screen (but only if the parameter is specified exactly
as TYPE=pref).  A cleaner way of parsing out the parameter values
is in the works.

* Added a few more `convenience functions' to the vcard API.

* Help screen has been updated.

* Man page has been updated with the mdoc template format as specified
in mdoc(7).

Rolo 008 (2003-04-20)

* Revamped the entire libvcard with a brand-spanking-new API.  Now
there are only two typedefs that the user programmer needs to know
about: vcard_component and vcard_component_param.

* Added more telephone numbers and email addresses to the
telecommunications display screen.

* Added ability to use the left and right arrow keys to switch
between the 5 groups in the view screen.

* Source code will also be distributed in Tar/Bzip2 format from now
on.

Rolo 007 (2003-04-10)

* The view screen has now been simplified to 5 groupings.  The help
screen has been updated to reflect these changes.

Rolo 006 (2003-04-04)

* The view screen is now split-up into 8 screens for grouping the
contact entry into managable viewing sections.  More vCard properties
have been added to the view screen as a result of this grouping
format--entries such as longitude and latitude.  The grouping format
is based on the sections described in the RFC 2426 specifications
for vCard version 3.0.

* VCard entries are now read from file with the vCard lines in the
order that they appear.  This eliminates the funny problem of having
the vcard lines displayed in the reverse order that they appear in
the contacts.vcf file when editing.

* A man page has been created for rolo(1).

* Updated the view help screen to match the functionality implemented.

Rolo 005 (2003-03-29)

* A datafile is created upon the startup of rolo if it does not
already exist.  The datafile is at $HOME/.rolo/contacts.vcf.

* Fixed a core dump upon adding the first entry in an empty datafile.

* Performance improvements for those cases where an edit, add, or
delete is aborted--the index refresh is spared in those circumstances.

* Updated the help screens to match the functionality implemented
thus far.

Rolo 004 (2003-03-23)

* Added `edit' functionality.  Press the `e' key in the index screen
or the view screen to use.  The editor defined in the environment
variable EDITOR will be used for editing the entry.

* Users can now add a new entry by pressing the `a' key in the index
screen.  The editor defined in the environment variable EDITOR will
be used for creating the new entry.

* Added `delete' functionality.  Press the `d' key in the index
screen to use.  It will only ask for confirmation once before
proceeding and there is no way to undo the delete, so be careful.

* And, of course, all these extra features are documented in the
index help screen which can be reached by pressing the `h' key.

Rolo 003 (2003-03-07)

* Now sorts ascending by family name on startup.

* Added `sort' functionality to the index screen.  Press the `s'
key to use.

* Added `filter' functionality to the index screen.  Press the `f'
key to use.

* Added `remove filter' functionality to the index screen.  Type
`F' to use.

* And, of course, all these extra features are documented in the
index help screen which can be reached by pressing the `h' key.

* Can resize to larger dimensions in an xterm window without crashing.

Rolo 002 (2003-02-28)

* The source code is now distributed with a proper `configure'
script.  Refer to the `INSTALL' file for details on how to use it
to compile and install Rolo.  This means Rolo should be able to run
on a more diverse list of operating systems and environments (thanks
to autoconf and automake).

* The help screens should be more relevant to the screens they give
help about.

* An example data file can be found in the `test' directory.  After
rolo is installed, the example data file can be loaded by using the
`-f' option on rolo.

Rolo 001 (2003-02-22)

* This is the first release of the Rolo package.  It has been
developed and tested on FreeBSD 4.7.  Keep in mind that you will
need a file in your `%{HOME}/.rolo/' directory titled `contacts.vcf'
and in the same format as the `data.vcf' file format (which is in
vCard 3.0 format).  This release only has capabilities to read from
the file and display the entries to screen.
