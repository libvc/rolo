Rolo 003 (2003-03-07)

* Now sorts ascending by family name on startup.

* Added `sort' functionality to the index screen.  Press the `s'
key to use.

* Added `filter' functionality to the index screen.  Press the `f'
key to use.

* Added `remove filter' functionality to the index screen.  Type
`F' to use.

* And, of course, all these extra features are documented in the
index help screen which can be reached by pressing the `h' key.

* Can resize to larger dimensions in an xterm window without crashing.

Rolo 002 (2003-02-28)

* The source code is now distributed with a proper `configure'
script.  Refer to the `INSTALL' file for details on how to use it
to compile and install Rolo.  This means Rolo should be able to run
on a more diverse list of operating systems and environments (thanks
to autoconf and automake).

* The help screens should be more relevant to the screens they give
help about.

* An example data file can be found in the `test' directory.  After
rolo is installed, the example data file can be loaded by using the
`-f' option on rolo.

Rolo 001 (2003-02-22)

This is the first release of the Rolo package.  It has been developed
and tested on FreeBSD 4.7.  Keep in mind that you will need a file
in your `%{HOME}/.rolo/' directory titled `contacts.vcf' and in the
same format as the `data.vcf' file format (which is in vCard 3.0
format).  This release only has capabilities to read from the file
and display the entries to screen.
