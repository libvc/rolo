* vcard.h: Prototypes for four more `convenience functions'.  This
saves the user programmer a little bit more time.  Mostly for
retrieving the `preferred' telephone and email of a given vCard.

* vcard.c: Definitions for four more functions.  Mostly for retrieving
the `preferred' telephone and email of a given vCard.

* vc_parse.y: Parse the parameter tokens a little more so that the
name and value can be extracted.  Only does a dumb parse of grabbing
both sides of an `=' character.  This will need to be fixed up
later.

* vcard.c: Fixed vc_get_next_by_name so that it starts its search
after the given vcard_component.  It'll make it easier for the user
programmer to use this function because then the user programmer
will not need to acquire the next vcard_component manually before
calling the vc_get_next_by_name function again.

* vcard.h: Big changes.  Revamped the entire API.  Now there are
only two typedefs that the user programmer needs to know about:
vcard_component and vcard_component_param.  No more iterators.

* vcard.c: Changes to coincide with those described for vcard.h.
Every function has a description!  These changes took approximately
12 hours to complete.

* vc_parse.y: The parser had to be touched up to work with the new
API.

* vcard.c: Replaced all structs with their respective typedef
counterparts.

* vcard.c: Changed fprintf_vcard to accept const vcard.
* vcard.h: Changed fprintf_vcard to accept const vcard.

* vcard.c: The insert_vcard_item now preserves the order of the
items inserted.

* vcard.h: Added a few defines that were missing and prettied the
code.

* Makefile.am: Added noinst to the library because it is not finalized
yet.  Added ChangeLog as file to distribute.
