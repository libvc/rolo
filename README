Rolo - contact management software
Version 010

Copyright (C) 2003  Andrew Hsu

Rolo keeps track of your contacts and display them to you with a
text-based menu.  Rolo strives to be a well-constructed tool for
complimenting text-based email programs-such as mutt.  It utilizes
the vCard version 3.0 format for storing its contacts and it
interfaces with the end-user through a NCurses front-end.

Rolo is written in ANSI C and uses Automake and Autoconf to manage
its build system.  Rolo makes uses of the NCurses library and the
menu library that compliments NCurses.  It has been developed and
tested thoroughly on FreeBSD, but the code was designed to be as
non-platform specific as possible.

A vCard library was written specifically for rolo using Flex and
Bison.  The library handles scanning a vCard file, parsing the vCard
file into a data storage structure, manipulating the data storage
structure, and writing back to file.  This library will be split
off in the future as its own separate package which Rolo will require
as a dependency.

To add a new contact in rolo, type `a' in the index screen.  This
will pop open your "favorite editor" so you can compose a new vCard
file by hand.  This may be a little low-level for some people, so
an example vCard file has been provided in the `test' directory.
If rolo is installed using an rpm file, the example file can be
found in: /usr/share/doc/rolo-010/contacts.vcf

A mutt query_command utility is included with the rolo package.
This utility will allow queries to the data file (defaults to
~/.rolo/contacts.vcf) from mutt using mutt's query_command (see
muttrc(5) for more info).  In order to get this to work, you must
add the following line to your ~/.muttrc file after installing the
rolo package:

  set query_command="mutt_vc_query '%s'"

And you will then be able to query email addresses when you use the
`Q' command in mutt.
