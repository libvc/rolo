rolo - contact management software
release 011

Copyright (C) 2003  Andrew Hsu

Rolo keeps track of your contacts and display them to you with a
text-based menu.  Rolo strives to be a well-constructed tool for
complimenting text-based email programs-such as mutt.  It utilizes
the vCard version 3.0 format for storing its contacts and it
interfaces with the end-user through a NCurses front-end.

Rolo is written in ANSI C and uses Automake and Autoconf to manage
its build system.  Rolo makes uses of the NCurses library and the
menu library that compliments NCurses.  It has been developed and
tested thoroughly on FreeBSD, but the code was designed to be as
non-platform specific as possible.

To add a new contact in rolo, type `a' in the index screen.  This
will pop open your "favorite editor" so you can compose a new vCard
file by hand.  This may be a little low-level for some people, so
an example vCard file has been provided in the `test' directory.
If rolo is installed using an rpm file, the example file can be
found in: /usr/share/doc/rolo-011/contacts.vcf
