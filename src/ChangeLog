* view.c: Have the `i' key in the view screen exit to the index
screen.

2003-03-27  Andrew Hsu

* index.c: Reduced the length of a few strings that were unnecessarily
long.  Fixed a core dump problem when the first contact entry is
added to a new datafile.

* view.c: Prettied the code and trimmed a string.

* help.c: Removed the attempts at having the help screen scroll.
Updated index and view help screens.

2003-03-27  Andrew Hsu

* main.c: At startup, rolo will now create the default datafile and
datafile directory if it does not already exist.

2003-03-26  Andrew Hsu

* add.h: Renamed enum to something proper.

* delete.h: Renamed enum to something proper.

* edit.c: Renamed edit_vcard function to edit_entry.  Had edit_entry
function return a status value.
* edit.h: Renamed enum to something proper.  Changed prototype for
the edit function.

* help.c: Began to implement help screen scrolling functionality.

* main.c: The screen will now be refreshed depending on the return
value of edit_entry.

2003-03-25  Andrew Hsu

* add.c: New file added.  Moved add_entry function to here.
* add.h: New file added.  Prototype for add_entry.

* entry.c: New file added.  Moved all the functions dealing with
entry nodes to here from the index.c file.  This includes the
sorting, filtering, and manipulation of the entry node structure.
This file will need to be cleaned up so that the user of this module
will not have to touch the internals of the entry node structure
directly.  Perhaps a rename of the `entry node' would also have to
be performed for the sake of not having it confused with the
`add_entry' and `delete_entry' functions.
* entry.h: New file added.  Prototypes and struct definition for
the `entry node' functions taken from the index.c file.

* main.c: Adding a new entry now checks to see if the add was
successful so that a screen refresh could be spared if the add was
aborted.

* edit.c: Moved the add_entry function into its own file.
* edit.h: Moved the add_entry prototype into its own file.

* index.c: Moved all the functions dealing with the `entry node'
into its own file: entry.c.
* index.h: Moved the sorting enum into the entry.h file.

* help.c: Added a comment reminder for a future feature: export.

* Makefile.am: Added the new files add.c, add.h, entry.c, and entry.h
to the list of source files to compile.

2003-03-24  Andrew Hsu

* delete.c: New file added.  Moved delete_entry function to here.
* delete.h: New file added.  Prototype for delete_entry.

* main.c: The screen will only be refreshed if the delete is
successful.

* edit.c: Moved delete_entry function into its own file.
* edit.h: Moved delete_entry prototype into its own file.

* Makefile.am: Added delete.c and delete.h to the list of files to
be compiled.

2003-03-23  Andrew Hsu

* edit.c: Doc fixes.
* view.c: Doc fixes.

2003-03-22  Andrew Hsu

* main.c: Added case statements for WINDOW_DELETE and WINDOW_ADD.
These statements will handle the new `delete' and `add' commands.

* edit.c: Created the functions that actually do the adding and
deleting of the vcard entries.  Changed the `edit' functionality
of the edit_vcard function to call upon the EDITOR as a way to edit
the vcard.  Steering away from the forms-based solution for now
just so that editing functionality can be implemented for a start.
Not sure if a forms based solution will exist in the future.  Also,
a few static functions were added in support of the newly exposed
functions.

* edit.h: Changed the prototype for edit_vcard and added prototypes
for adding and deleting.  The prototypes may be renamed in the
future so that they do not use the word `vcard' in them so that
they do not conflict with the libvcard interface.

* index.c: Added case statements in the process_index_commands
function to process adding and deleting commands.  Created a new
external refresh_index function that will maintain the item index
selection after a refresh.

* index.h: Added new enums for the add and delete index commands.
Exposed the new refresh_index function.

* view.c: Added the edit command to the header bar.

* help.c: Added new commands to the help window for view and edit.

2003-03-07  Andrew Hsu

* main.c: Uses config.h define to print version.

* help.c: Cleaned up the help screens.

2003-03-06  Andrew Hsu

* index.c: Finished implementing the sort ascending functionality.
Just need to take care of the sort descending sometime.  Note: the
code is a bit ugly...may need a smarter way of going about it.  For
now, it works--it just has a lot of duplicate code.

2003-03-05  Andrew Hsu

* index.c: Lots of changes!  Added sort and filter functionality
(filter functionality is here thanks to the recommendation by Tony
Granberg).  Also replaced lots of usage of COLS with proper calls
to getmaxyx().  Had to introduce a few more static global variables
to work around the problem of refreshing a display after a filter
is applied.  The cleanup of the memory is well taken care of (I
think).  The toughest part was moving the intern data structure
(pre-ITEM data structure) to a linked list and then stuffing the
linked list into an array for sorting.  But it works and it is
implemented well and I'm happy.  There still needs to be a cleanup
of the static globals, as mentioned earlier, which will most likely
amount to an interface change on the main.c side as well.  Sorting
still needs to be completed on all other fields (see FIXME comments).
* index.h: Removed some completely unnecessary prototypes and also
added new ones for the new work performed to add sort and filter
functionality to the index.  New enum for sorting as well.
* help.c: Added the new commands for filter and sort to the index
help screen.

* main.c: Resizing of windows should now not crash (except when the
window is resized to less than 80 cols wide).  Added a check for
whether get_current_item() returns a valid item before trying to
view the entry (stops rolo from core dumping).

2003-03-03  Andrew Hsu

* index.c: First attempt at adding sort capabilities for the index.
This will have to be redone because the entry numbers are not sorted.
* index.h: Prototype and enum for sort function.

2003-02-28  Andrew Hsu

* Makefile.am: Changed stuff to make the compile run smoother.
Added ChangeLog as one of the files to distribute.

2003-02-27  Andrew Hsu
