mutt_vc_query - vCard address query utility for mutt

Copyright (C) 2003  Andrew Hsu

Add the following line to your ~/.muttrc file:

  set query_command="mutt_vc_query '%s'"

And you will then be able to query email addresses stored in your
local `contacts.vcf' file from mutt when you use the `Q' command.
